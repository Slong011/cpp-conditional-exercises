# C++ Conditionals Exercises - Sydney Long

## Overview
This repository contains my practice exercises in C++, focusing on conditionals, comparison operators, and logical operators. These exercises helped me learn how to use `if` statements, logical expressions such as `&&` (and) and `||` (or), and modulus `%` for divisibility. 

## Exercises Included
- Conditionals-Exercise-1.cpp : Check if a number is between 1 and 25, or 70 and 100.
- Conditionals-Exercise-2.cpp : Check if a number is divisible by 5.
- Conditionals-Exercise-3.cpp : Check if a number is divisible by 5, and is even. 

## How to Run
These programs take a command-line argument as input (number x to evaluate). 

To run an exercise:
1. Compile the program (using a C++ complier)
2. Run the program and provide a number after the program name as the input for x
